        Atiyamāṉ (also known as Adhiyamān, Adigamān or Satyaputra-Atiyān) were a royal Velir dynasty. 
        These king-chiefs ruled from their capital Tagadur[3] (present day Dharmapuri) from at least the 3rd century BCE.
        The royal house was one of the four kingdoms of Tamilakam, ruling parts of the Kongu Nadu.
        They were surrounded by the Cheras to the west and the Pandyas and Cholas to the east.

        about clinic:
        <br>
        A clinic (or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic) is a health facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients. Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded.
        They typically cover the primary care needs of populations in local communities, in contrast to larger hospitals which offer more specialized treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays

        garden:
        <br>
        A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the cultivation, display, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. 
        The single feature identifying even the wildest wild garden is control. The garden can incorporate both natural and artificial materials.[1]
        Gardens often have design features including statuary, follies, pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry creek beds, and water features such as fountains, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks. 
        Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants. Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale, as in a market garden). Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses.[2]

        the lake:
        <br>
        A lake is a naturally occurring, relatively large body of water localized in a basin surrounded by dry land.
        [1] A lake generally has a slower-moving flow than the inflow or outflow stream(s) that serve to feed or drain it.
        [2] Lakes lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they form part of the Earth's water cycle by serving as large standing pools of storage water. 
        Most lakes are freshwater and account for almost all the world's surface freshwater, but some are salt lakes with salinities even higher than that of seawater.

        <br>
        A temple (from the Latin templum) is a building reserved for spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice.

        Islam (whose temples are called mosques), Judaism (whose temples are called synagogues), Zoroastrianism (whose temples are sometimes called Agiary), the Baha'i Faith (which are often simply referred to as Baha'i House of Worship) 
        Taoism (which are sometimes called Daoguan), Shinto (which are sometimes called Jinja), Confucianism (which are sometimes called the Temple of Confucius), and ancient religions such as the Ancient Egyptian religion and the Ancient Greek religion.
